DigiNumber Algorithm

Algorithm for method digitfrequency():

1. Store string value of number.
2. Create two arrays to hold digits and frequency
3. Iterate through all digits
4. 	 If the current digit is at its last index in the number
5.		 Iterate through all digits from that digit to the start of the number
6.			 If a digit is equal to the digit 
7.				 Increment frequency counter variable
8.	     Add the digit to the array, and its corresponding frequency
9.	     Reset counter variables
10.Print out the corresponding elements of the digit array and the frequency array

Algorithm for method sumDigits(long n):

1. If the number is 0, return 0.
2. Else add the last digit of n to the sum of the digits of n/10.
